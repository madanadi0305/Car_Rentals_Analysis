About: 
Stats:
The average number of trips taken is 37
The average rating for various renters is 4.92
The average daily rental rate or revenue earned is $91.

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we found these insights:
1. As most of the ratings are above 4.0, this means that the customers are very positive and happy about the experience provided by the car rental.
This meand that they provide very efficient services to their customers because of which there are very few complaints.
However, to know more about the efficiency, the  company can also include reviews and customer descriptions about the services for better understanding of the issues.

2. Most of the vehciles rented are Cars(Sedans and other small cars), followed by SUVs, Minivans and trucks.
   This helps us have a sneak peek into the type of customers that rent the vehicle. Since most of the vehicle rented is by individuals or single family or couples.
   Some of the rentals are available for bigger fsailies like SUVs and Minivans.
   The suggestion here would be for the rental to partner up with event management companies or mainly for recreational purposes to encourage more customers purchasing their minivans and logistic companies to increase the renting of trucks.
3. Most of the vehicles available mainly operate on Gasoline followed by EV, Hybrid and Diesel.
4. The daily rental rates seem to be affordable and cheap with most of the rental rates between 40 and 80 which means that the rental vehciles are usually cheap. However, to engage their customers more than once, they can provide offers and other purchase deals and can also offer premium or luxury options that are little expensive.
